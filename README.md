# Introduction

This is the first mission of my internship at Vates.

The goal was to compare various JavaScript drawing libraries by coding a simple static graph to highlights their differences.

# Tested libraries

## [BonsaiJS](http://bonsaijs.org/)

**Pluses**

+ Easy to animate.
+ Good and full documentation, easy to read.

**Cons**

- Does not seem to be made for interactivity.
- Data hard to integrate.

With BonsaiJS we have a full documentation easy to read.

I see a very little shift with the position of circle of all library.

This library is really good to animate but i think it is is not fitted to use with our  problem because not much for interactivity and using data files.

## [D3.js](http://d3js.org/)

**Pluses**

+ Create for manipulating documents based on data.
+ lot of tutorial and example.

**Cons**

- Lag on safari with some example.

With d3js we can manipulating documents based on data files.
I think this library can be the best for respond our requiremend.
But d3js hard to understand.

## [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/)

**Pluses**

+ few code line.
+ easy to use.

**Cons**

- **TODO**

With processing.js we have a good solution to draw and interactivity with few code
line.
I think is a good library to draw and easy interactivity.


## [Two.js](http://jonobr1.github.io/two.js/)

**Pluses**

+ Lot of tutorial and example.
+ Easy to use.

**Cons**

- not really do to animate.

With Two.js we have an easy library for draw.
I think it was not a good library cause not enough interactivity.

## [Verlet-js](https://github.com/subprotocol/verlet-js)

**Pluses**

+ we can modify easily the origin of our object.

**Cons**

- No documentation.
- No tutorials only example of source code.

The main problem of this library don't have documentation and need to analyse example
source or library code to understand how to use function.

But this a simple  physics engine written.

# Conclusion

**TODO**
