# Introduction

This is the first mission of my internship at Vates.

The goal was to compare various JavaScript drawing libraries by coding a simple static graph to highlights their differences.

# Tested libraries

## [BonsaiJS](http://bonsaijs.org/)

**Pluses**

+ Good and full documentation, easy to read.

**Cons**

- Does not seem to be made for interactivity.

With BonsaiJS we have a full documentation easy to read.
I see a very little shift with the position of circle of all library.

## [D3.js](http://d3js.org/)

**Pluses**

+ Create for manipulating documents based on data.
+ lot of tutorial and example.

**Cons**

- Lag on safari with some example.

With d3js we can manipulating documents based on data files.
I think this library can be the best for respond our requirement.
But d3js hard to understand.

## [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/)

**Pluses**

+ few code line.
+ easy to use.
+ proper language.

**Cons**

- **TODO**

With processing.js we have a good solution to draw and interactivity with few code
line with his proper code language, who look like C language .
I think is a good library.


## [Two.js](http://jonobr1.github.io/two.js/)

**Pluses**

+ Lot of tutorial and example.
+ Easy to use.

**Cons**

- **TODO**

With Two.js we have an easy library for draw.
I think it was not a good library cause not enough interactivity.

## [Verlet-js](https://github.com/subprotocol/verlet-js)

**Pluses**

+ we can modify easily the origin of our object.

**Cons**

- No documentation.
- No tutorials only example of source code.

The main problem of this library, no documentation and need to analyse 
source example or library code to understand how to use function.
But this a simple  physics engine written.

# Conclusion

**TODO**
